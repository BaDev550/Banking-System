I was so bored at school today that I whipped up something for the Library Management System a few hours ago. It’s got a few features, but there’s no saving to files. Don’t ask why—I was just too lazy, lol.

Anyway, I’ll give you the same admin login info: "Admin" "1234." I mean, it would’ve been pretty tough to guess if I didn’t give it to you, right? As an admin, you can add new people, delete users,
and change their ranks. Normal users can withdraw cash and add money to their accounts. That’s pretty much it. What more do you need?

Let me know if you need anything else!

NOTE: I deleted some sht called MAIN.ipch I hope it doesn't fuck up all the project :D
